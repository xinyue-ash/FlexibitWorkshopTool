## How to start the program 
2 ways:
* Rendered link: [https://flexibitworkshoptool-28j3.onrender.com/](https://flexibitworkshoptool-28j3.onrender.com/) 
* If want to run on local machine ( for tests during development)
    1. Clone from with following command
       ```bash
           git clone https://github.com/xinyue-ash/FlexibitWorkshopTool.git
           cd ardublockly
           git submodule update --init --recursive
       ```
  
* (the last command will run for a while, please allow enough time for it to finish, so that the submodule will be download in ‚Äúclosure-libaray‚Äù folder) 
    3. Run `python ./start.py`. And go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser


## How to add new Categories and Blocks: 
  A nice example from the original repo `\build\blocks\groove` or existing categories `\build\blocks\Customization` etc

1. **Folder Setup for Categories**
  To add a new category, follow these steps:
    1) Create a Category Folder	Navigate to `\build\blocks\` and create a folder named after your desired category. This category name will appear in the menu (e.g., ‚ÄúCustomization‚Äù or ‚ÄúPreset Behaviors‚Äù).

    2) In `\build\blocks\<category>`, include the following files:
       * `blocks.js` ‚Äì Defines the blocks.
       * `generator_arduino.js` ‚Äì Generates Arduino code for the blocks.
       * `blocks_config.json` ‚Äì Stores block configurations.
         
2. **To define a block:**
      Go to `\build\blocks\<category>\blocks.js`
    * Reference the Google Blockly tutorials on block definition for guidance.
      * [https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/define-blocks](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/define-blocks) 
    * For help creating blocks visually, use the Blockly Block Factory.
      * [https://technologiescollege.github.io/Blockly-at-rduino/tools/factory/block_factory.html?lang=](https://technologiescollege.github.io/Blockly-at-rduino/tools/factory/block_factory.html?lang=) 
    * Changing color:
      * [https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/block-colour?_gl=1*jezlx1*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTE3NjI3MTcxNC4xNzI2](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/block-colour?_gl=1*jezlx1*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTE3NjI3MTcxNC4xNzI2MDM0MTQz*_ga_R5G2Y6GLVC*MTcyNjAzNDE0Mi4xLjEuMTcyNjAzNDE0Mi4wLjAuMA) 
    * Changing texts on the block
      * need to change parameters in `.appendField()`
    * Example:
  
    ```C++
        Blockly.Blocks["block_123"] = {
          init: function() {
            // Block definitions go here
          }
        };
    ```
    
3. **Define Code generator:**
  To generate Arduino code for your block:
  Go to `\build\blocks\<category>\generator_arduino.js`. You can store [Arduino APIs](#arduino-apis) for this interface as variable and return those code.
  Example: code generation in for block in example 2d (block name (eg: `block_123`  should match the one in block defination (block.js) )
   ```C++
          Blockly.Arduino[‚Äúblock_123‚Äù]= function (block){
           // add your code converter logic here 
          }
   ```
   
4. **Add  blocks' XML defination the Toolbox:**

    To add your blocks to the toolbox, update the following files with the necessary XML configurations:
      * `\build\blocks\<category>\blocks_config.json`
      * `\build\blocks\blocks_data.json`
      * `\build\ardublockly_toolbox.js`
      
        > üí° **If a block definition already exists in another category**
        > - let say if in category C2 I want to add a block "jump", but "jump" block ready have defination in category C1 (aka, has defined in all files `\build\blocks\C1\`)
        > - Then, you only need to add XML defination of "jump" in `\build\ardublockly_toolbox.js` under category `C2` element tag , there is **no need** to add XML defination in `\build\blocks\<category>\blocks_config.json` and  `\build\blocks\blocks_data.json`
   
        
        > üí° **If you want to change a Category name:**  
        > - you need to change the directory name `\build\blocks\<new_category_name>`
        > - In `\build\blocks\<new_category_name>\block_config.json` and `\build\blocks\blocks_data.json` , need to change `categoryName`, `toolboxName` field, and the `id` and `name` attributes in the `<category>` tag in "toolbox" field to be the new category name.
        > - In `\build\ardublockly_toolbox.js`, change the the `id` and `name` attributes in the `<category>` tag of this category

6. **Test Changes:**
    Run `python ./start.py`. And go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your browser.
    For your changes to take effect, perform a hard refresh:
    * Open the browser console with `F12`.
    * Right-click the refresh button.
    * Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload."


## How to deploy to render
* there are two branches that are up-to-date and very important
    * `flask`: the deloyment branch, everything pushed into this branch will automatically deloyed to Render server.
    * `master` : has all the up-to-data code, serve as a back-up branch for flask (deployment branch)
 
      
## Arduino APIs 

Sample Arduino Sketch is in **\Hardware\MultiControWithDelay.ino**


### Data Structure ###
  *  A `Target` struct stores the configuration a the atomic behavior. There are two kinds of configuration
      * Angle, duration when useSpeed = false
      * Angle, speed when useSpeed = true
        
  * A `Sequence` is a sequence of one or more atomic behavior that defined by corresponding `Target` struct
    
  * `ServoController` Class
    *  Manages behavior and states for each servo. Initialized with arrays of `Target`, `Sequence`, and `Servo` instances and other state variables
         * **Main Methods:**
            * `Attach()`
            * `Update()`
            * `StartNewSequence()`
            * `SetRepeats()`
            * `ResetSequence()`
            * `setAngleDuration()`
            * `setAngleSpeed()`
            * `addDelayDuration()`
        * **Private Helper:**
            * `addTargetToSequence()`
              
        > :bulb: **Tip:** One ServoController is initialized for _EACH servo._

        
### Wrapper Block (Purple Block) ###

![alt_text](image/purple_block.jpg)

  * This block initializes Target, Sequence, ServoControllers, and Arduino‚Äôs setup() and loop() methods. It also instantiates three ServoControllers:

    * Flexibit 1: servo_9 (pin 9)
    * Flexibit 2: servo_10 (pin 10)
    * Flexibit 3: servo_11 (pin 11)

  * The conversion logic for this block is in: `\build\blocks\Customization\generator_arduino.js`
      * (under `Blockly.Arduino['multi_servo_control']` )
  * Note: The block replaces `__SERVO_PIN__` with the actual pin number when a behavior block is placed in a Flexibit slot.

### **Atomic Behaviors**

These helper functions can be encapsulate in servo behavior blocks in `generator_arduino.js` :

1. `.setAngleDuration(int angle, int duration)
`Move the servo to a specified angle over a duration (ms).
2. `.setAngleSpeed(int angle, int speed)
`Move the servo to a specified angle at a speed (1 = slow, 10 = fast).
3. `.StartNewSequence()
`Start a behavior sequence (must be called before `setAngleDuration` or `setAngleSpeed`).
4. `.SetRepeats(int repeatTime)
`Set how many times the sequence will repeat (called after `setAngleDuration` or `setAngleSpeed`).
5. `.addDelayDuration(int duration)
`Stop the servo for a specified duration (ms).

![alt_text](image/behavior_code_exp.jpg)

**Note:** The servo reference inside the block must use the pattern `servo__SERVO_PIN__` to allow the purple wrapper block to replace `__SERVO_PIN__` with the correct pin number.
